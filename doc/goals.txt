* store tracked features in VCS, not another tool
* absolute prioritisation of all features (per status)
* store features per-branch
* store the feature database in plain-text files that play well with VCS and diff/merge tools
* don't re-implement functionality that is already in the VCS
* simplify correlation of commits to tracked features
