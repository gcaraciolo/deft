Goals / Principles

* store tracked features in VCS, not another tool
* absolute prioritisation of all features (per status)
* store features per-branch
* store the feature database in plain-text files that play well with VCS and diff/merge tools
* don't re-implement functionality that is already in the VCS
* simplify correlation of commits to lifecycle of tracked features


Deliberately postponed

* More readable identifiers for features (maybe just use their names or Tag URIs?)
* Performance (efficient data structure for storing and querying feature priorities)
* Integrate Deft into VCS tools themselves
