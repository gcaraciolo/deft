Deft: Easy Distributed Feature Tracking
=======================================

Deft is a simple distributed feature tracker (aka issue tracker, task tracker) designed to work with a distributed version control system such as Git.

Goals / Principles
------------------

* store tracked features in VCS, not another tool
* all features have status (e.g. new, in-development, ready-for-testing, ready-for-deployment)
* absolute prioritisation of features that have the same status
* store feature database alongside the code
* store the feature database in plain-text files that play well with VCS and diff/merge tools
* don't re-implement functionality that is already in the VCS

Issue Tracking
--------------

Issues are tracked with Deft itself.  If you want to raise issues:

* Fork the repo & check it out locally
* 'make env' to build the Python development environment
* use the './dev-deft' command to create a new issue
* commit the new issue
* send a pull request

Yes... there should be a tool to make this process simple.
