Deft: Easy Distributed Feature Tracking
=======================================

Deft is a simple distributed feature tracker (aka issue tracker, task tracker) designed to work with a distributed version control system such as Git.

Goals / Principles
------------------

* store tracked features in VCS, not another tool
* all features have status (e.g. new, in-development, ready-for-testing, ready-for-deployment)
* absolute prioritisation of features that have the same status
* store feature database alongside the code
* store the feature database in plain-text files that play well with VCS and diff/merge tools
* don't re-implement functionality that is already in the VCS

Future Plans
------------

Following the maxim "Make it work. Make it clean. Make it fast.", the following issues are postponed for now until the tool does what I want and is useful for small projects

* Integrate Deft with specific VCS tools more seamlessly
* Visualisation and estimation of history, such as Cumulative Flow Diagrams and velocity estimation
* Scaling (efficient data structure for indexing features by priority to handle large feature databases)
